      Hi, this is Fu-Chang, a physicist by training who wants to solve real-world (and must be fun) problem by statistical evidence using machine learning approach. At the early and growing stage of buzzy big data era, domain knowledge remains its crucial role to interpret the results obtaining from machine learning. Such techniques should not be treated as a magic black box which can provide <i>some</i> products by feeding <i>some</i> data. As a physics graduate, who has solid background in mathematical and statistical modeling with research experience in materials science regime, I am confident I will be a perfect fit for the position solving data-driven problems. I am so excited about telling the story <b>to</b> human being based on the learning process <b>from</b> the machine. Currently I am seeking for the opportunity  of being a data scientist.
