### What big-data problem would you solve that can benefit society at a large scale?

> Big data techniques could be used for job seeker to find a perfect match- this idea is very similar to a recommendation system. The job seeker provides the relevant information, such as technical skills, resume, working experience, etc. These data can be analyzed and compared with the database provided by the individuals who got hired recently, and then the most appropriate job allocation/opening is suggested. The job seeker and employer can save a tremendous amount of money and time during the process. Because time spending on job hunting is decreased, the unemployment rate should also go down. Moreover, the service might provide "straightforward" advice for job seeker. Then, they can work on improving specific skills in order to get matched with the best job.

### How do you see data science and machine learning affect the way we design software?

> I think data science and machine learning techniques are great tools to offer customized need in an instance. For instance, the user can type in a sentence describing his current feeling in an app, then the program could give a music playlist, a nearby restaurant with suggestion for the meal, or a cozy coffee shop with recommended book to read. The techniques could provide the platform for us to live in a better life. The robotic steward is programmed connecting to all the appliance. He/she knows your daily schedule, favorite tv channel, and the preference of making coffee. They can remind you that there are no eggs in the refrigerator, and even automatically make the purchase. In my opinion, data science and machine learning are the powerful techniques which can be greatly implemented for breaking the boundary of imagination.

### What is the most interesting fact or trend you've learned from analyzing data?

> It is very exciting to witness the pattern/tendency from a disordered data and then to tell a story about it with convincing evidence.
