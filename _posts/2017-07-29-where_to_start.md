I find the [plan](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-data-science-python/) particularly straightforward to being a Kaggler on Python. The author also provides lots of useful references within the article.

Happy learning!
