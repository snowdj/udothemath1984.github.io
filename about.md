    <p class="bio">
      Hi, this is Fu-Chang, a physicist by training who wants to solve real-world (and must be fun) problem by statistical evidence using machine learning method. At the early and growing stage of buzzy big data era, domain knowledge remains its crutial role to intrepret the results obtaining from machine learning techniques. It should not be treated as a magic black box which can provide <i>some</i> products by feeding <i>some</i> data. As a physics graduate, who has solid background in mathematical and statistical modeling with research experience in materials science regime, I am confident I will be a perfect fit for solving data-related problems interdisciplinarily. I am so excited about telling the story <b>to</b> human being based on the learning process <b>from</b> the machine. Currently I am seeking for this type of opportunity.
