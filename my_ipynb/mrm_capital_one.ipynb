    "The risk comes from defective models and misuse of the models. Effective MSM can improve an institutions's earnings through cost reduction, loss avoidance, and capital improvement. Cost reduction and loss avoidance come mainly from increased operational and process efficiency in model development and validation, including the elimination of defective models.\n",
