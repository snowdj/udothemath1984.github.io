It has been said that [feature engineering](https://www.slideshare.net/gabrielspmoreira/feature-engineering-getting-most-out-of-data-for-predictive-models) is one of the most important factor of getting good results (accuracy) in data science [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction). Here is a hands-on demonstraction, combining with the [big data tools](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/unveiling-page-views-csv-with-pyspark) for solving the problem.

Happy learning!
