The [slides](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs578/2005fa/CS578.bagging.boosting.lecture.pdf) covers the basic concept of bagging and boosting.

The [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest//model.html) is short for "Extreme Gradient Boosting", which has been greatly implemented in lots of winning competitions.

Happy learning!
