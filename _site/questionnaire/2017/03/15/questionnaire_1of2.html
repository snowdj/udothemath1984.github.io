    <h3 id="describe-a-time-you-experienced-a-challenge-while-building-a-productproject-and-how-you-overcame-it">Describe a time you experienced a challenge while building a product/project and how you overcame it:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two years ago, I participated in the Hackathon event held at the Materials Research Society 2015 Fall. We teamed up, collected ideas, created a strategy, and finished the final project within 24 hours. None of us had a strong coding background. There were more than enough times we modified our plan due to the lack of coding ability. We even felt that we couldn’t get things done two hours before the presentation. I suggested that we develop our minimal working example then make improvements gradually. Even though our final project was very different from our initial intention, we came in third place and received a special prize. The first lesson I have learned is to never, ever give up. The second lesson is that one should adapt to change and build things up progressively. The last lesson is that we shouldn’t fight alone, but always work with other passionate people!</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-qualities-you-most-desire-in-a-work-environment-andor-manager">What are the qualities you most desire in a work environment and/or manager?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The qualities I most desire in a work environment and/or manager are: cooperation and competition. I wish that I could both cooperate with my co-workers and smartly compete with myself by holding myself to the highest of standards. If my manager can value my work in the same way that I value it, that would be ideal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="describe-a-unique-experience-youve-had-and-how-it-changed-your-perspective">Describe a unique experience you’ve had and how it changed your perspective:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before I started my PhD journey (physics major), I thought science was the most important subject. Physics teaches us how things work, chemistry tells us how things interact, and math shows us how thoughts can be written down. Approaching the end of my study, I realized that I was wrong. Science is important, but it is only one of the important issues/topics/subjects. After all, we learn different tools in trying to understand the world (as much as we can). I have become more open-minded and learned to appreciate this diversity. As long as one is dedicated to something that they care about and which has a good impact on society, that is valuable.</p>
