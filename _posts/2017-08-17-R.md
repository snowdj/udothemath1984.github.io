A very [comprehensive post](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r#gs.7lCShvc) of how to use R in the Jupyter notebook environment. For the best practice, always stay with the [good style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) so that the idea is interchangable and can be widely distributed.

Happy learning!
